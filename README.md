# SQL-Project6-ScienceQtech-Employee-Performance-Mapping

**DESCRIPTION**
ScienceQtech is a startup that works in the Data Science field. ScienceQtech has worked on fraud detection, market basket, self-driving cars, supply chain, algorithmic early detection of lung cancer, customer sentiment, and the drug discovery field. With the annual appraisal cycle around the corner, the HR department has asked you (Junior Database Administrator) to generate reports on employee details, their performance, and on the project that the employees have undertaken, to analyze the employee database and extract specific data based on different requirements.

**Objective:** 
To facilitate a better understanding, managers have provided ratings for each employee which will help the HR department to finalize the employee performance mapping. As a DBA, you should find the maximum salary of the employees and ensure that all jobs are meeting the organization's profile standard. You also need to calculate bonuses to find extra cost for expenses. This will raise the overall performance of the organization by ensuring that all required employees receive training.
